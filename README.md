# BoxOut
Variant of Microsoft's JezzBall game, in which players must divide a rectangular space into smaller regions by drawing walls without hitting moving balls. 
Created for Northeastern University's CS2500: Fundamentals of Computer Science Accelerated.

Players can click to create the center of a wall, which will then grow outward in the currently set direction (either horizontal or vertical). Players can toggle this direction by typing "t". If a wall hits a moving ball, it will be cleared and the player will lose a life. The player must clear 75% of the total board in order to move on to the next level, at which point they gain an extra life.
